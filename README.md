- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Santiago Cejas! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full stack. It's my first approach to studying something purely technological, (which is a challenge, since I have a degree in management).
I am excited to learn new things!
- ðŸ“« You can find me in https://www.linkedin.com/in/santiagocejas/ or in my mail, santiagonicolas.cejas@gmail.com
